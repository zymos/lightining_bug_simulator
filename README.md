# Lightning-bug Simulator
Desciption: Blinks 17 LEDs to simulate a bunch of lightning bugs blinking. The microcontroller generates a random sparse blink pattern, with on-time less than a second and off-time from 5-50 seconds. The LEDs can be spread out with buried, camouflaged, or hiden wires.  The LEDs can be attached to rods stuck in the ground.

# Hardware
* Arduino, I used Arduino Pro Mini, Should work with most or any AVR with minor changes
* 240-330 Ohm resistors for 5V
* 120-180 Ohm Resistors for 3.3V
* Common green LEDs in series with resisors
* Wires: recomended dark grey in rocky area, dark brown in grass or dirt.  Avoid light grey, black and green.  They don't blend in well.  I used old usb cables of the darker grey, and thermostat wire for dark brown.
* Metal rods: to allow the LEDs to stick above ground.  I used bike spokes
* Heat shrink tube with adhesive, and/or hot-glue to insulate wires, as well as attach LEDs, wires, and rods
