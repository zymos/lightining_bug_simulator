=Lightning bugs emulator=
Desciption: Blinks 17 LEDs to simulate a bunch of lightning bugs blinking. 
Spread the LEDs out in your garden or anywhere for a bunch of sparse random blinks.

=Hardware=
*Arduino, I used Arduino Pro Mini, Should work with most or any AVR with minor changes
*240-330 Ohm resistors for 5V
*120-180 Ohm Resistors for 3.3V
*Common green LEDs in series with resisors
* Wires: recomended dark grey in rocky area, dark brown in grass or dirt.  Avoid light grey, black and green.  They don't blend in well.  I used old usb cables of the darker grey, and thermostat wire for dark brown.
* metal rods: to allow the LEDs to stick above ground.  I used bike spokes
* heat shrink tube with adhesive
